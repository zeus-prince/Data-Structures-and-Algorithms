# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is a book on the topic "Data Structures and Algorithms"
## Description : 
This book is for aspiring developers who want to learn about the fundamentals of *Algorithms* and *Data structures*, understand how they work, implement them and also visualize them. Each chapter will contain a handwritten notes as pdfs, an implementation in Python program and if possible, a visualization of the topic in order to better understand it. This book will cover a variety of algorithms from standard sorting algorithms to graph algorithms and even some miscellaneous algorithms. It may aslo be accompanied by a series of videos if possible.
